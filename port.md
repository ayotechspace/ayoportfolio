# PROJECT ONE

I'm building a to-do list for my first project inorder to showcase my learning journey as a Telegram Mini App Developer. 

currently done with the UI/UX phase, my actual motive behind this project strongly resides in the path of me laying my hands on github, telegram bot and cloudflare, serving as a medium for me to gain realtime experience from concepts.

in the next phase, I'll handle the logics behind this project, but cloudfare would be utilized in the second segment of my project, not on this phase.
